🎯 Project Workflow
This project implements an end-to-end system for classifying plant leaf diseases using a CNN. The process is broken down into several key stages.

1. Setup and Environment
The initial phase involves setting up the environment and preparing the dataset.

Import Libraries: Imports essential Python libraries, including TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy.
Mount Google Drive: Connects to Google Drive to access the dataset stored in the cloud.
Unzip Dataset: Extracts the compressed dataset into the local environment, making image files accessible for training.
2. Data Preprocessing and Augmentation
This stage prepares the image data for the model.

ImageDataGenerator: Utilizes Keras's ImageDataGenerator for two critical tasks:
Rescaling: Normalizes pixel values from the [0, 255] range to [0, 1] to improve training stability and performance.
Data Augmentation: Applies random transformations (rotation, zoom, shear, flips) to the training images. This artificially expands the dataset, which is a crucial technique for preventing overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen images.
Data Loading: The flow_from_directory method loads images, resizes them to a uniform dimension (e.g., 224x224), and organizes them into batches.
3. CNN Model Architecture
The core of the project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), built as a Sequential model.

Convolutional & Pooling Layers (Conv2D, MaxPooling2D): These layers work together to automatically extract features from the images, such as textures, patterns, and shapes relevant to diseases.
Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
Dense Layers: Fully-connected layers that perform the classification based on the extracted features. The final Dense layer uses a softmax activation function to output a probability score for each disease class.
Dropout Layer: A regularization technique that randomly deactivates a fraction of neurons during training to prevent overfitting.
4. Model Training
The model is configured and trained in this section.

Compilation: The model.compile() step configures the training process by specifying the Adam optimizer and the categorical crossentropy loss function, which are standard for multi-class image classification.
Training: The model.fit() function trains the model by iterating over the dataset for a specified number of epochs. During this process, the model learns to map the input images to their correct labels.
5. Evaluation and Prediction
After training, the model's performance is evaluated.

Performance Visualization: Generates plots of accuracy and loss over epochs to diagnose the training process.
Prediction: A function is defined to preprocess a new, unseen image and use the trained model to predict the disease class.
Model Saving: The final trained weights are saved to a file (e.g., model.h5), allowing the model to be deployed without retraining.
📊 Model Performance and Evaluation
Key Performance Metrics
Accuracy: The overall percentage of correct predictions.
Precision: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions. High precision indicates a low false-positive rate.
Recall (Sensitivity): Measures the model's ability to identify all relevant cases. High recall indicates a low false-negative rate.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.
Visualizing the Results
Accuracy and Loss Plots: These graphs are essential for visualizing the model's learning progress and identifying issues like overfitting.
Confusion Matrix: A grid that provides a detailed breakdown of classification results, showing exactly which classes the model is confusing.
Practical Demonstration
The ultimate test involves feeding new, unseen images to the model and evaluating its predictions and confidence scores, proving its value as a real-world diagnostic tool.
